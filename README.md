### Major Step A1: File Creation
#### Method 1: Using a Licensed Scraping Software
1. **Software Use**:
   - Scrape specific databases like Le Parle Grosjean (French Yellow Pages).
   - Overcome restrictions and captchas manually.
   - Specify keywords and regions for searches (manually handled currently).

2. **Data Extraction**:
   - Gather information including email addresses.
   - Emails undergo a deliverability test within the software.

3. **Handling Missing Emails**:
   - Use a second software to extract emails directly from company websites.
   - If emails are still missing, use Google App Store's import tool to fetch emails from the web.

4. **Manual Search**:
   - For remaining companies without emails, manually search on Google and Facebook.

#### Method 2: Using Database of Compass
- Fetch company information from the Compass database.

#### Method 3: Using Google Maps
- Extract company details from Google Maps.

### Major Step A2: Merging and Deduplication
1. Merge the three files generated from the methods in A1.
2. Eliminate duplicate entries.
3. Handle companies without valid emails (strategy needed).

### Major Step A3: Email Campaigns
1. **File Preparation**:
   - Divide the merged file by regions based on postal addresses.
   - Assign appropriate prices, titles, and email content for each region.

2. **Automation**:
   - Use the API of the email campaign service (e.g., Sender) to automate the sending process.

3. **Final Interface**:
   - Develop an interface where entering a keyword and selecting a country initiates the entire automated process.

### Steps to Automate
1. **Captcha Handling**:
   - Implement a solution to automatically solve or bypass captchas.

2. **Region-Specific Searches**:
   - Automate the iteration through regions for each keyword search.

3. **Deliverability Test and Backup Methods**:
   - Ensure all emails pass the deliverability test.
   - Automate fallback methods to find missing emails.

4. **File Merging and Deduplication**:
   - Automate the merging of files and deduplication process.

5. **Email Campaigns**:
   - Integrate with the email campaign service API to automate region-specific campaigns.

6. **Final Interface Development**:
   - Create an intuitive interface for initiating the process with minimal input.
